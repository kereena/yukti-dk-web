    <h2>Hello, we are KOKILA</h2>
    <p>
      Our passion is IT, research and development and education. What we sell is <a href="#software-development">intelligent software development</a>, and <a href="#consulting">consulting</a> in a process of <a href="#outsourcing-to-india">outsourcing to India</a> to make use of a <b>large talent-pool</b> and to <b>make it cost-effective</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our Indian office is in Kavali, India, where we have good relations to the local colleges <a href="http://www.vitskavali.com/">VITS Kavali</a> and <a href="http://www.veckavali.com/">VEC Kavali</a>, while in Denmark we have a partner company. Our partner in Denmark is for creating contact with Danish and European companies, while the project, development and consulting phases are carried out at our office in India. At both locations, we pride ourselves to have a strong network within the educational community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many companies wish to reap the benefits of the large talent-pool and the low-cost salaries and facilities in India, however, they find it hard to manage the cultural gap between the western world and India. KOKILA is founded by a Danish/Indian couple, where we bring knowledge from both worlds. The development team in India is managed by Danish and Indian managers. Communication with clients and review of deliveries is done by a <b>Danish manager local to the developer-team in India</b>.

    <p>
    We know other technologies as well, please <a href="#!request-for-proposal">contact us</a> directly for queries regarding your specific project, it is very likely we can help you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our speciality is development of intelligent software. By intelligent software
    we understand the use of fuzzy logic and machine learning. We often find that
    companies do not know these techniques and are not using them to solve problems
    which would otherwise become complex software with time-demanding maintenance tasks.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Software which is natural to use</dt>
      <dd>Fuzzy models can quantify words and use the words for calculations. Instead of asking the user to select an exact value between 1 and 10, the user can chose linguistic values such as "less good" or "excellent". The fuzzy model quantifies these inprecise definitions and allows to use the values for making precise measures.</dd>
      <dt>Software which can "think by itself"</dt>
      <dd>The computer can not think by itself, but, fuzzy models and machine learning can support taht you do not need to explicitly hardcode large rulesets in your programs. Instead the program will adapt rules, given a set of examples.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
    <b>Fuzzy logic example: Calculating ADSL speed from multivariate data:</b>
    In an expert-system for calculating possible ADSL bandwidth, there was five different broadband measuring-systems. The client's previous system used a workflow based on the assumption "try the best system first, and use this measurement." (see <a href="#eqn-1">Eq. 1</a>)
    We proposed and implemented a new system based on a weighted fuzzy model and a fuzzy knowledge-operator to calculate the possible bandwidth by using input from all available measuring-systems. Domain-experts at the client's side helped to determine precision of each measuring-system. (see <a href="#eqn-2">Eq. 2</a>)
    </p>
    <div class="math">
      \label{eqn1}
      h = s_1 \vee s_2 \vee s_3 \vee s_4 \vee s_5
    </div>
    <div class="math">
      \label{eqn-2}
      h_f = \oplus{}( (0.9, s_1), (0.8, s_2), (0.5, s_3), (0.5, s_4), (0.3, s_5) )
    </div>
    <p>
    By changing the system into a system based on a fuzzy logic model, the precision was increased in the expert-system, and the client's sales department could give a better estimates for customers, often with mode bandwidth. In the end, more revenue to the client.

    <h2>Pricing</h2>

      We categorize our developers as follows: 1) junior developers - smart developers with limited real project experience; 2) senior developers - developers with good experience in international projects.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <!--
    <p>Junior developers are selected candidates from universities in Tirupati. They all hold a masters degree in software engineering, computer science or information technology. After hiring, they have received three months training at KOKILA, before they are available for you. Senior developers are like junior developers, except they have good experience in working with international projects from minimum three previous projects.
